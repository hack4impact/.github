# Hack for Impact 

## Mission
Hack for Impact is a student-run 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is committed to building software for nonprofit organizations. We connect students with nonprofits to build technology that serves communities and to create lasting social change, fostering the wider adoption of code for the common good. 

## Story
Hack for Impact was founded in 2014 with the idea that students at universities should have the opportunity to combine their skills in software with their passions of helping the world around them, especially in their local communities. Since its inception, 12 university programs have created their own local chapter and have helped over 210 nonprofit organizations with software from volunteer management systems, map resource applications, and much more. We've supported over 1200 volunteers with their social good journey, and we hope to help even more in the future.
