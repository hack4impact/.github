# Hack4Impact 👋

## Mission
Hack4Impact is a student-run 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is committed to building software for nonprofit organizations. We empower engineers, designers, activists, and humanitarians to create lasting and impactful social change, fostering the wider adoption of software as a tool for public interest. Common code for the common good.

## Story
Hack4Impact was founded in 2014 with the idea that students at universities should have the opportunity to combine their skills in software with their passions of helping the world around them, especially in their local communities. Since its inception, 16 university programs have created their own local chapter and have helped over 100 nonprofit organizations with software from volunteer management systems, map resource applications, and much more. We've supported over a two thousand student members with their social good journey, and we hope to help even more in the future.
