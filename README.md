# .github

This is the default repository for Hack4Impact. It defines the documents that every open-source Hack4Impact project should start with. Chapters that want to suggest changes please submit a feature request to this repository. 

Some documents will be automatically referenced: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `FUNDING.yml`, etc; others will need to be edited per repository: `README.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc. Chapters and teams are expected to complete all necessary documentation and maintain it accordingly.
